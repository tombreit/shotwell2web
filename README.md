# shotwell2web

*Build a web image gallery from a [Gnome Shotwell](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Shotwell) image database. See it in action on [photography.thms.de](https://photography.thms.de/)*

üñº What this python script does: 

1. Query shotwell sqlite database for a given tag
1. Get tagged images, resizes, set image metadata
1. Generate a html image gallery for these images
1. The generated 'static bundle'/'public directory' is self-contained, [photoswipe-enabled](https://photoswipe.com/) and could be served via filesystem or via webserver


## üßª Requirements

* Python3
* Phil Harvey‚Äôs `exiftool` (will be used by `pyexiftool`)
* Shotwell instance with tagged photos


## üîß Configuration

This python script expects an `ini` file named `shotwell2web.ini` in the project root directory: 

```ini
[PhotoSrc]
# tag: Supports only one tag to query for
tag = MyPhotoTag
shotwell_db_path = /path/to/.local/share/shotwell/data/photo.db

# For testing, limit the number of photos which will be processed.
# Leave empty to process all photos.
process_n_photos = 3

[Website]
# These strings end up in image metadata and in html
title = Photography
photographer_name = John Doe
photographer_email = mail@example.org
photographer_www = https://example.org
legal_link = ["Legal", "https://example.org/legal.html"]
privacy_policy_link = ["Privacy Policy", "https://example.org/privacy.html"]

[ImageRenditions]
# The - maximum - image dimensions for thumbnails (`_sm`) and, hm, not-thumbnails (`_lg`)
img_size_lg = 1280, 960
img_size_sm = 178, 100
```

## ü¶ò Run

```bash
# initial setup
cd <project-dir>/
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# build web gallery
python3 -m shotwell2web

# serve web gallery
python3 -m http.server -d public/
```

> Yes they are in the sqlite db file.  Here's a perl routine I use to

> the PhotoTable, VideoTable, and TagTable from the sqlite db.  The

> the below code, which starts with the string "thumb" for photos and
> the string "video-" for videos.

            @$videotable )
    );

    my $select_tagtable_sql =

    foreach my $row (@$tagtable) {
        my $name = $row->[0];
        $name =~
          s/^\///;    # trim leading / (not sure why it is present in database)

> The photo_id_list column holds the comma-separated list. Each item in the list is of the form:
> - ‚Äúthumb‚Äù or ‚Äúvideo-‚Äù depending on whether the item is a photo or a video
> - 16 hex digits, zero padded, which is the ID value from the PhotosTable or VideosTable for that item
> - a comma
> Full example of extracting tags for the video file 2019/12/31/20191231_121604.mp4:

```sql
# via sql

> If that is not completely clear:
> - The ID for that video file is 553
> - 553 in hexadecial is 229
> - Pad that to 16 digits, add ‚Äúvideo-‚Äù at the front and ‚Äú.‚Äù at the end (even the last item in the list has a comma at the end)
> - Search for that string in photo_id_list
> - If a row matches then the name column is a tag that is attached to that file
